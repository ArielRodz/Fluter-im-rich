_**I Am Rich**_  is an  iOS application developed by Armin Heinrich and which was distributed using the  App Store. When launched, the screen only contains a glowing red gem and an icon that, when pressed, displays the following  mantra  in large text

> I am rich  
> I deserv  it  
> I am good,  
> healthy & successful

The application is described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all", with its only purpose being to show other people that they were able to afford it. _I Am Rich_  was sold on the App Store for  US$999.99  (equivalent to $1,164 in 2018), €799.99, and  GB£599.99  (equivalent to £786.43 in 2018), the highest price Apple allowed for App Store content. The application was removed from the App Store without explanation by  Apple   the day after its release, August 6, 2008


Eight people bought the application, at least one of whom claimed to have done so accidentally. Six US sales at $999.99 and two European ones for €799.99 netted $5,600 for developer Armin Heinrich and $2,400 for Apple. In correspondence with the Los Angeles Times , Heinrich told the newspaper that Apple had refunded two purchasers of his app, and that he was happy not to have dissatisfied customers
